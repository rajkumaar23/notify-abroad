## But why ?
When I came to the US for my master’s, it was an unavoidable need to have access to the OTPs or calls that come to my Indian number, which, by the way, I left at home. Since it was not feasible to make a human relay the OTPs every time the Indian number received one, I built this app to forward them automatically to my Telegram chat.

Try out the application if you’re planning to go abroad or share the application with those who are planning to.
